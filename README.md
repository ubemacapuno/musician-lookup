## Musician LookUp: <a target="_blank" href="https://codepen.io/corey-damocles/pen/qBobYYL">Interactive codepen.io Demo Here</a>!

This application uses <strong>promises, async/await, and try/catch</strong> with TheAudioDB API by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theaudiodb.com/about.php">TheAudioDB.com</a>.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API by TheAudioDB.com. 
You can also view an interactive demo version hosted on Netlify <a target="_blank" href="https://musician-lookup.netlify.app/">here.</a>

## Optimizations:
In the future, I'd like to use a front-end framework to spice up the UI. Also figure out a way to incorporate lazy-loading on the images so the loading seems cleaner.
